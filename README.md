# Painful Memory

A basic "memory" game built using [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). It features photos of people - and maybe non-people - in the process of getting hit in the face with inanimate objects.

_Don't worry_; they're all fine now.

## How to Play

Fortunately, playing is simple! All you have you do to start is click on one of the tiles. When you do that, you will gain a point, and the tiles will all be shuffled. If the next tile you click on is one that you haven't clicked on before, you will gain another point, and the the tiles will be shuffled again.  However, **if at any point you click on a tile you have already clicked on, you will lose all your points and have to start over.**

If you click all the tiles without repeating one, then it means you are only the fourth person to ever win the game.
